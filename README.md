This repository contains the code, and data used in our work on predicting ZIF-8 crystal morphology via machine learning. 
Our approach combines literature-derived data with in-house experimental results using an XGBoost-based incremental learning approach. 
For full methodology, data description, and analysis details, please refer to our paper (incremental learning with hetergenous data for morphology prediction in metal-organic framework) submitted to Computational Materials Science, which is under reviw.
